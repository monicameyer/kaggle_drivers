This project includes several scripts used in the feature extraction/exploratory data analysis of the driver telematics data for the Kaggle competition.
================
feature_extraction.R
Use this script to turn the data in each folder into corresponding tables in CSV format.
To run this, simply change the "path" variable in the .R script to match the location of the driver folders.
