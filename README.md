Kaggle: Driver Telematics
================
This project contains several folders related to the Kaggle Driver Telematics anomaly detection competition. Given a set of files representing driving trips, the task is to establish a driver fingerprint and predict, with some confidence, whether or not a particular driving file matches our established driver fingerprint.  
  
Specifics:  
We are given over 2700 folders, and within each folder is 200 CSV files. Each CSV represents a single driving trip taken. Supposedly, each folder of 200 files represents a single driver. However, not all of the 200 files in each folder actually belong to our given driver, and so we must detect some unknown number of anomalies (with some probability) within each folder.  
  
Feature Extraction  
=============  
feature_extraction.R  
Use this script to turn the data in each folder into corresponding tables in CSV format. To run this, simply change the "path" variable in the .R script to match the location of the driver folders.  
  
Exploratory Data Analysis  
=============  
exploratory_data_analysis.R  
Use this script to generate some basic histograms to visualize the distributions of the different features extracted within a given folder. Again, simply change the path variable in the .R script to the location of the data, this time to the '_summary.csv' files generated by the feature extraction process.  
  
Modeling
=============  
Currently attempted several supervised as well as unsupervised learning techniques to detect anomalies, given our set of extracted features.
